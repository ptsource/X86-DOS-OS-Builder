# Purpose Statement

The purpose of the  PTSource X86-DOS-OS-Builder is to preserve and study the Microsoft DOS open-source codebase while making it practical and relevant for modern retro-computing, education or research. This project exists to safeguard an important piece of computing history by maintaining compatibility with the original DOS architecture, behavior, and design principles, while carefully and occasionally extending it with optional improvements, fixes or components.

 PTSource X86-DOS-OS-Builder is a flexible system creation toolkit designed to build minimal custom DOS-compatible operating systems for x86 hardware, based on the Microsoft DOS open-source codebase. It allows developers, educators, and retro-computing enthusiasts to assemble tailored DOS systems by selecting, configuring, and integrating core OS components, device drivers, and utilities. The builder supports customization of the kernel, command interpreter, memory managers, and startup configuration, making it possible to create minimal DOS systems. With a focus on clarity, modularity, and compatibility, the  PTSource X86-DOS-OS-Builder is ideal for experimentation, learning operating system internals, preserving legacy software, and developing specialized DOS distributions for real hardware, emulators, or virtual machines.

### Note
PTSource X86-DOS-OS-Builder uses the Microsoft DOS open-source codebase wich is based on MS-DOS 4.0, although some fixes to this code were applied PTSource X86-DOS-OS-Builder is ment to be used for minimal systems. If you want a full DOS system 100% compatible with MS-DOS, PC-DOS, DR-DOS and with Windows 3.11 enhanced mode support take a look at our [PTSource MiniVMDOS](https://store.ptsource.eu/soft/mvmdos/) 

## Building

PTSource X86-DOS-OS-Builder builds in any DOS environment, even in DOSBox. A DOSBox portable distribution is provided for that effect.

## Instructions

* Download this repository
* Extract the contents of the repository and move it maintaining the directory structure inside the DOSBox folder C:\DOSSTRAP
* Verify that the CONFIG.BAT points to C:\DOSSTRAP
* Run BUILD and wait
* A complete distribution will be avaliable in the DISTRO folder
