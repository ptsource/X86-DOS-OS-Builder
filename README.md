#### [![ko-fi](/images/ko-fi.png)](https://ko-fi.com/ptsource) For updates and change logs.

X86-DOS Operating System Builder is a flexible system creation toolkit designed to build custom DOS-compatible operating systems for x86 hardware, based on the Microsoft DOS open-source codebase. It allows developers, educators, and retro-computing enthusiasts to assemble tailored DOS systems by selecting, configuring, and integrating core OS components, device drivers, and utilities.

The builder supports customization of the kernel, command interpreter, memory managers, and startup configuration, making it possible to create minimal embedded DOS systems or fully featured desktop-style environments. With a focus on clarity, modularity, and compatibility, the X86-DOS Operating System Builder is ideal for experimentation, learning operating system internals, preserving legacy software, and developing specialized DOS distributions for real hardware, emulators, or virtual machines.

# Purpose Statement

The purpose of the X86 DOS Operating System Builder is to preserve, study, and enhance the Microsoft DOS open-source codebase while making it practical and relevant for modern retro-computing, education, and research.

This project exists to safeguard an important piece of computing history by maintaining compatibility with the original DOS architecture, behavior, and design principles, while carefully extending it with optional improvements, fixes, and modular components. The builder enables developers, hobbyists, and educators to create customized DOS-based operating systems for x86 hardware, emulators, and virtual machines without compromising historical accuracy.

By providing clean build tools, documented sources, and configurable components, the X86 DOS Operating System Builder encourages experimentation, learning, and innovation, ensuring that classic DOS technology remains accessible, understandable, and usable for future generations.
