# X86 DOS Operating System Builder

X86-DOS Operating System Builder is a flexible system creation toolkit designed to build custom DOS-compatible operating systems for x86 hardware, based on the Microsoft DOS 4.0 open-source codebase. It allows developers, educators, and retro-computing enthusiasts to assemble tailored DOS systems by selecting, configuring, and integrating core OS components, device drivers, and utilities.

The builder supports customization of the kernel, command interpreter, memory managers, and startup configuration, making it possible to create minimal embedded DOS systems or fully featured desktop-style environments. With a focus on clarity, modularity, and compatibility, the X86-DOS Operating System Builder is ideal for experimentation, learning operating system internals, preserving legacy software, and developing specialized DOS distributions for real hardware, emulators, or virtual machines.
